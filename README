phpMyAuctioneer
---------------

This system was created in the first year of my studies at the University of
Applied Sciences in Osnabr√ºck as a homework (a few years ago).
It works but it is not production ready from a security perspective. Work must
be done on the SQL injection problems.

The system itself produces XML code using PHP classes which are rendered by the
browser using XSLT transformations.
The code is sowewhat hacked as it embedds most strings within the code. I'll fix
that if I find some time...

phpMyAuctioneer can be used and redistributed under the terms of the AGPL v3.
If you have questions, suggestions, patches, etc. write to christian(at)lins.me.
